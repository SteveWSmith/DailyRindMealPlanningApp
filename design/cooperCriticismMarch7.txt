Met with Cooper during SE Class on March 7, 2019
Presented our work from the last time that we met

Request from Slacks
	integrate functionality to remind about epi pens / said nah fam
	
Where have you spent the most time? Answer: Spent the most time in the design phase

Cooper said seeming like JSON object specs seem much more advanced then general specs
Look at what we've done, fold it back in - start to ID input/output so we can reign it in

Opportunity to develop more in functional requirements - it's time to update since we've done a lot of work

Non-functional requirements? Doc is unfinished, don't have much

If using spiral, should be getting an artifact out each rotation
Have someone else look at artifact for client input, so we can improve

Hoodie guy with glasses: Android and iOS? Said yes
