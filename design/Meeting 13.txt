-server
database population - Alberto
route creation - Alberto
database query setup - amber
middleware calls - angelo

-client and server
route docs - already done
server docs - er diagrams, uml diagrams, already done
FR review - kind of general, but that's okay since they are dynamic and are expected to change - feel free to create docs for this, like user manuals
GUI Design* - super super urgent, 2 weeks overdue apparently / Caitlyn says she has it already
Spiral design doc
3 method design doc

Until server is finished, client can only do design

Make sure that the screens are completely tested - ensure that there are no invalid inputs, make buttons unclickable as needed, etc etc

Then after docs + presentation, work on making the application pretty

Status update for tomorrow:

What have we done since last meeting
Planning and design
Selected tech
took recommendation of using cross platform tool - using react native
Planning stage of first protoype for the first spiral, already practiced with coding, made login, made some documentation, and created a timeline

Would use the week after the 22nd for features
Server should be fully bug checked at the 18th
Functional Client should be fully bug checked after the 22nd

=====================


DB designed
Schema not online yet, but should be up soon
Routes are already set up - we just need to make function calls that are specified in UML diagram
SQL Queries - UML diagram should have them
Look at code right now, looks messy, but there are no comments / names should be descriptive enough
Beyond that... that's pretty much it
